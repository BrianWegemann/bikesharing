# **Overview**
## Purpose
### The purpose of this analysis is to provide investors with insights into the Citibike program using New York City as an example. This infomration will help encourage the investors to invest in a project in Des Moines.

# **Results**
## **Checkout Times for Users**
### The majority of users checkout a bike for less than 20 minutes with the majority of rides being 5 minutes long. 

## **Checkout Times by Gender**
### Most users who use the bikes are men but there is no significant difference in trip times between men and women.

## **Trips by Weekday for Each Hour**
### Looking at the heatmap, we can see that most weekday rides occur between 6-9 AM in the mornings, and 4-7 PM in the evenings. This is likely due to the fact that most people in the US work 9-5 and will use the bikes to get to and from work. Weekend rides are most common between 10 and 5PM. 

## **Trips by gender by Weekday**
### Taking a look at trips by gender and weekday we can see that it is simlar to the data on the last page. The main difference is that men use the bikes much more often.

## **User Trips by Gender by Weekday**
### When factoring the usertype data into the analysis we can see that the subscribers have no unknown gender data. This is likely because the app requires subrcibers to disclose more personal information than standard customers.

## **Top Starting Locations**
### Most rides start in midtown NYC.

## **Top Ending Locations**
### Most rides end in midtown NYC. This makes sense as ride durations are typically 5 minutes long.

# **Summary**
## **Final Thoughts**
### Using the data from the analysis, we found that most rides were around 5 minutes lojg and most of the userrs are men. This indicates that most bike sharing stops should be approximately 5 minutes apart from one another, and should target work areas and metro/bus stops. Two additional visualizations that could be helpful would be top starting and ending locations colored by gender and and another chart comparing ride durations during warmer and colder months.
